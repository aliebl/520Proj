There were a few changes that had to be made to files including: alarm-wait.c, Make.tests, 
Rubric.alarm, tests.c, and tests.h. I also had to create a new file: alarm-mega.ck to run the alarm.

In the files that had to be modified, I looked at the examples already given from alarm-single and alarm-multiple,
and added in lines of code for alarm-mega.

In the alarm-mega.ck I simply changed the alarm function from being called 7 times to being called 70 times.
